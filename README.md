# ⚡Lab2 - Data Collection and Pre-processing

## 🧠 Context

This project applies a 12-step data engineering workflow to a realistic e-commerce dataset. It covers ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering using Python and pandas. The goal is to convert raw sales and product metadata into a structured, insight-ready format. We implement custom functions, serialize the enriched data, and generate a merged data dictionary. The final notebook delivers both analytical insights and reusable code in a clean, modular format.
